# CS230
Contains work from CS-230 at SNHU


For this project, I worked with a client called The Gaming Room. They needed a multiplayer game called Draw It or Lose It that would work across different platforms, like web and mobile. One of their top goals was ensuring that different teams could play at the same time without messing up each other’s games. They also wanted the design to be something they could easily scale up later on.

I think I did a good job organizing the software design document and explaining everything clearly, especially when it came to showing how the pieces would fit together. Going through the process of writing out the design first helped a lot because it made it easier to think about the bigger picture before jumping into code. If I had to go back and change anything, I’d probably spend more time making the diagrams cleaner and more detailed, because they could have portrayed the apllication better.

It was clear that the user needed an apllication that runs smoothly and efficiently across a variety od devices, and so I focused a lot of making that a priority in the design. You really have to start with the users needs because otherwise you are only trying to sell them a need. I have always liked the way Steve Jobs talked about starting with the user and working backwards to the technology, not creating something and then trying to sell it. I think that applies here. 

Overall, I approached this by starting with the client’s main goals, breaking things down into smaller parts, and thinking about how everything would connect. In the future I would probably, as I jsut said, start with the user and get their needs before beginning the process of creating a design template. I would also become more proficient at creating pseudo-code, because I think that would be helpful in understanding if a design makes sense (is feasible).
